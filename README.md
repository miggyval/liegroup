# LieGroupPy

A lightweight and modular Python framework for Lie groups and Lie algebras, designed for robotics, control theory, estimation, and optimization research.

This library provides a clean, extensible base class for Lie groups, and implementations for common groups such as:

- **SE(2)** — Planar rigid transformations
- **SE(3)** — 3D rigid transformations
- **SO(2)** — 2D rotations
- **SO(3)** — 3D rotations
- **U(1)** — The unit circle group (complex numbers of magnitude 1)
- **UnitQuaternions** — S³ rotation group (quaternion unit sphere)
- **ℝ Additive** — Real numbers under addition
- **ℝⁿ Additive** — Vectors under addition (factory generated)
- **ℝ⁺ Multiplicative** — Positive reals under multiplication

Full support for exponential/log maps, Jacobians, adjoints, random sampling, and Lie brackets.

Full test suite using **pytest**, checking group axioms, inverses, Lie algebra consistency, adjoint properties, and Jacobian behavior.

## ✨ Features

- Abstract base class `LieGroup` with type generics
- Group operations: `compose`, `inverse`, `identity`
- Algebra operations: `exp`, `log`, `hat`, `vee`
- Adjoint representations and left Jacobians
- Random sampling (`randn`, `randu`)
- Distance functions on manifolds
- Full test coverage with multiple random trials
- Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) example on general Lie groups
- Trajectory visualization tools for different groups

## 📦 Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com//LieGroupPy.git
cd LieGroupPy
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 🧩 Usage Example

```python
from liegroup import SE2, SO3

# Create a random element
X = SE2.Exp(np.random.randn(3))

# Compose two elements
Y = SE2.Exp(np.random.randn(3))
Z = SE2.compose(X, Y)

# Logarithmic map
v = SE2.Log(Z)

# Exponential map
Z_back = SE2.Exp(v)

# Distance
d = SE2.distance(X, Y)

print(f"Distance between X and Y: {d}")
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

All operations are tested over random samples using `pytest`.

To run all tests:

```bash
pytest tests/
```

Tests include:
- Group axioms: identity, associativity, inverses
- Exponential and logarithm consistency
- Adjoint actions and Lie bracket properties (Jacobi identity, antisymmetry)
- Jacobian inverses and perturbation consistency

---

## 🎯 EKF Example

An Extended Kalman Filter is provided for any Lie group:

```python
from liegroup import SO2, EKF

ekf = EKF(SO2)
t_arr, V_arr, X_arr = ekf.run()
```

Trajectory plotting included for 2D, 3D, and rotational groups.
